# Unicorn Command

A clone of the classic game [Unicorn Command](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_Command "Unicorn Command") in an HTML Canvas for The Odin Project's [Project: Using Canvas to Build Games in the Browser](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/building-games-with-canvas).

### Game Play

You have 3 anti-unicorn batteries each with 10 unicorns to be used to protect 6 cities.  Fire your unicorns at incoming enemy unicorns by clicking on the screen (anywhere your cursor is a crosshair).  Unicorns from your middle anti-unicorn battery travel faster than unicorns from your outer anti-unicorn batteries.  Protect your cities (and anti-unicorn batteries) by destroying the incoming enemy unicorns.

With each increasing level, more enemy unicorns are fired at your cities and unicorns, and the enemy unicorns travel faster.  Depleted unicorns will be replenished at the start of each level, but destroyed cities will not be.

### Scoring

Earn points for every enemy unicorn destroyed, and get bonus points at the end of each level for your unused unicorns and each city you protected.  Points are multiplied by a factor shown before each level.

### End Game

The game ends when all your cities are destroyed.
